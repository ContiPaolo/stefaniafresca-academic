Stefania Fresca is Assistant Professor in Numerical Analysis at MOX (Laboratory for Modeling and Scientific Computing) - Department of Mathematics, Politecnico di Milano, Italy. After carrying out her PhD in the framework of the ERC Advanced Grant Project iHEART (PI: Prof. Alfio Quarteroni) devoted to cardiac modeling, she spent two years as Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at MOX. Her research interests and expertise include scientific machine learning, reduced order modeling (data dimensionality reduction), deep learning, digital twins, numerical approximation of PDEs, with several applications to engineering problems.
